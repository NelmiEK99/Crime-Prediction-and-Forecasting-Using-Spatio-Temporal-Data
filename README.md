# Crime-Prediction-and-Forecasting-Using-Spatio-Temporal-Data

In this notebook, I explore the fascinating realm of crime prediction and forecasting using spatio-temporal data. Leveraging a comprehensive crime dataset, I delve into the core question of whether a person will be arrested or not. My journey takes us through various machine learning algorithms, offering insights into the predictive power of decision trees and random forests.
